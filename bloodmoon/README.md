7d2d mod

Have you ever played 7 days to die and thought, damn i wish valheim was like that? 

This mod ads a few things that doesn't change the overall valheim progression but adds flavor to the valheim experience. 

* Every 7 days there is a blood moon, mobs are enraged and hunt players. Prepare you defences!

* Points of Interest (aka locations) have difficulties, mobs and loot scaled by difficulty.

* Leveling up gives you attribute points to spend.

* You may find ancient scrolls containing perks when looting.
